Important Notes:
1. Does css transfor functions affect box model properties?
No, it doesn't. Therefore we can safely use them without affecting the spacing of other neighbouring elements.

2. in browsers upside is -y and down is +y

3. how much transition-duration is usually suggested for UI effects?
Usually 200-300ms works best.

4. when should we use % format in @keyframes instead of from-to format?
whenever we want multiple steps in the animation.
