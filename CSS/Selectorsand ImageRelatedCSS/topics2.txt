1. Which image related css can we use to preserve aspect ratio of the image?
both content-fit:cover and contain
but cover will do the cropping but will up completely
contain will not do cropping but image will be shrinked.

2. How to position an item in the center both vertically and horizontally using display flexbox?
use this css onto the flexbox container
display:flex;
justify-content: center;
align-items: center;
